ORM -> Object Relational Mapping
Object: instance of a class
Relational -> Relational DB -> SQL

classes and instance -> automatically create SQL tables and rows in the table

class -> table
object -> row in the table

table -> rows and columns

columns -> specified parts or attributes
class attributes convert to columns in the table
data -> row
object of your classes -> convert to rows in the table

Problems:
List
Set
Association
