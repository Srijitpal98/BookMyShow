ORM -> Object Relational Mapping
Object: instance of a class
Relational -> Relational DB -> SQL

classes and instance -> automatically create SQL tables and rows in the table

class -> table
object -> row in the table

table -> rows and columns

columns -> specified parts or attributes
class attributes convert to columns in the table
data -> row
object of your classes -> convert to rows in the table

Problems:
List
Set
Association

City -> List of theatres

Mumbai -> T1, T2, T3

Mumbai (-> row in the city table
    "Mumbai",
    <T1, T2, T3>
)

mapped to some rows in the Theatre


Auditorium has Shows -> 9-12,     12-3,       3-6,           6-9
                         S1        S2          S3             s4
                       titanic   Pushpa 2   Khaadan         Baby John

Show -> which movie, in which theatre, in which auditorium, with what features, which movie and what time


Theatre -> adding this to BMS
Theatre -> 4 auditorium -> 100 seats
max capacity -> 400

When we buy a ticket, we are not buying the seat but we are occupying the seat for a particular show
Class -> ShowSeat : combination of particular show


Theatre -> T1 -> A1
